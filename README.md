Landing Page

#### By

Connor Cummings

## Description

Very minimal landing page to host my personal code examples, as well, tell a little bit about myself.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

No server side clients necessary.

## Known Bugs

The center alignment on this page is off. Im not quite sure with the grid system that bootstrap supplies if it at all causes an issue for centrally aligning my content. Apparently, from what i was told by staff, we learned a previous version of bootstrap as well. That may have caused some confusion for me. I could've, and will later, make a new landing page without using bootstrap.
